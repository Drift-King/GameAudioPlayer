And also...
      Many-Many-Many More !!!
      Just make search (SCAN FILES in playlist window) !!!

NOTE: (*) means GAP is not tested with that game, but should work.
      If it does not work please mail me!

Supported are maybe, much more games, but I've got no opportunity to test
GAP with them. Select ALL game files in SCAN FILES and ADD FILES in playlist
window to search for supported audio files within game resource files.
The candidates to check:
DreamWorks Interactive Games (for BLB, BLBSFX plug-ins),
Blizzard Entertainment games (for MPQ plug-in),
Westwood Studios games (for AUD plug-in),
Sierra On-Line games (for SOL, WAV plug-ins),
Interplay/Black Isle games (for ACM, MVE plug-in),
ID Software and Raven Software games (for WAD, WADSFX plug-ins),
Electronic Arts games (for ASF, EACS and BNK plug-ins),
Parallax Software games (for DSND plug-in),
3D Realms games (for GRP plug-in),
Revolution games (for CLU/CLUSFX plug-ins),
Cryo Interactive games (for APC plug-in),
FunCom games (for ISS plug-in),
Maxis games (for XA plug-in),
FutureVision games (for CMP/FST plug-ins),
Origin games (for MGI plug-in).
Please let me know whether GAP works with these if you can!

=================================================
Tips and hints for dealing with game audio files
=================================================

IMPORTANT NOTE: Please take into account, that files of some formats can be
added to playlist ONLY by ADD FILES operation, while some other file types
can be added ONLY by SCAN FILES operation. Other file formats may be added
by both operations.
So, the general tip is to perform BOTH operations on ALL game files:
SCAN FILES and ADD FILES. This may lead to adding some audio files twice.
To avoid that (if that's undesirable) use the following approach:
while performing ADD FILES: if the dialog "Select files to process from
archive:..." appears, press SELECT ALL and OK or select files you wish to
process; while performing SCAN FILES: when the same dialog appears, press
SELECT NONE and OK (if you wish just to skip this archive) or CANCEL (if you
wish this archive to be scanned as plain file).
Note also, that for some games there're ready ANX playlists available with
GAP. You may want to use these premade APLs as they sometimes contain song
names and they're independent on CD-drive letter.

VIDEO SOUNDTRACKS PLAYBACK: In order to listen to video soundtracks
(.VQA, .TGV, .TGQ, .DCT, .MAD, .MVE, .UV, .UV2, .WVE, .FST) set the buffer
size to low value (but not too low!), something like 64KB/128KB for 4x
CD-ROM drive. In fact, this value depends greatly on your CD-ROM speed --
the higher the speed the larger buffer you may use.

The Neverhood (and other DreamWorks games):
BLBSFX audio files can ONLY be added to playlist by ADD FILES operation.
Use ADD FILES for .BLB files and select *.07 (sfx) and *.08 (music).

NFS'x, FIFA'x, NHL'x, NBA'x (and other Electronic Arts games):
Use ADD FILES for .ASF, .STR and .MUS files. Note that plug-in is able to find
audio stream in video files (.MAD, .DCT, .TGV, .TGQ, .UV, .UV2, .WVE) -- use
SCAN FILES for them. It's also a good idea to try SCAN FILES for all .BNK/.VIV
files in order to find speech and sound effects.
For older Electronic Arts games (like FIFA'96, NHL'96, NBA'96, NFS, etc.) make
search in .BNK and .CRD files. Songs (sometimes, sounds) are usually .ASF and
.AS4 files and speech files usually have extensions .SPH and .EAS.

KQx, GQx, Larry'x, SQx, GKx, etc. (and other Sierra On-Line games):
Make search in RESOURCE.SFX and RESOURCE.AUD files. Sometimes songs (and
sounds) are stand-alone .AUD files (in Larry7 and KQ8). GK3 music/sfx reside
in .BRN files -- make search in them.

Legend Of Kyrandia 3:
Songs are stand-alone .AUD files, which may be just added to playlist with
ADD FILES button. Speech is in .TLK files and sounds are in .PAK files --
make search in them. Malcolm's VQAs should be simply added by ADD FILES and
NOT SCAN FILES!

Fallout 1/2, Planescape: Torment (and other Interplay games):
Make search in *.DAT files. Before that you should enable ACM search in ACM
plug-in configuration dialog. Songs are stand-alone .ACM files (which could
be added to playlist with ADD FILES). .MVE video files sometimes reside in
.MVL/.EXE/etc files -- make search in them. Note that ACM songs of
Planescape: Torment should be added to playlist as STEREO files, not as MONO
(as ACM plug-in incorrectly detects) -- to do so you should set ACM plug-in
options accordingly: ACM channels -> use default, Channels default -> stereo.

DOOM, DOOM2, Heretic, Hexen (and some other ID/Raven games):
Press ADD FILES, choose all .WAD files and then press SELECT ALL in the
lump list dialog box, so that all sounds in .WAD will be added to playlist.

Descent 1/2:
Press ADD FILES, then choose DESCENT.PIG (for Descent 1) or DESCENT2.S11
and/or DESCENT2.S22 (for Descent 2) and then press SELECT ALL button in the
file list dialog box, so that all sounds in .PIG/.S11/.S22 will be added to
playlist. For Descent 1 all sounds are Unsigned 8-bit Mono 11025 Hz RAWs,
while for Descent 2 sounds in DESCENT2.S11 are Unsigned 8-bit Mono 11025 Hz
RAWs and in DESCENT2.S22 they are Unsigned 8-bit Mono 22050 Hz RAWs.

X-COM Apocalipse Demo:
Music should be added as RAW with the following parameters: Stereo, 16-bit,
Little-endian, 22050 Hz, Signed. Music files may be found in the MUSIC
subdirectory. Sounds are in RAWSOUND subdirectory and they should be added
with the following parameters: Mono, 8-bit, 22050 Hz, Unsigned.

Tomb Raider 3:
Scan AUDIO\CDAUDIO.WAD.

Duke Nukem 3D:
Use ADD FILES for DUKE3D.GRP and DUKE.RTS.

Rise Of The Triad:
Use ADD FILES for DARKWAR.WAD and REMOTE1.RTS.

Redneck Rampage:
Use ADD FILES for REDNECK.GRP and REDNECK.RTS.

Dark Forces:
Scan SOUNDS.GOB and JEDISFX.LFD.

TIE Fighter:
Scan SFXBLAST.LFD, TIESFX.LFD, TIESPCH.LFD (in RESOURCE subdirectory).

The Day Of The Tentacle and Sam & Max Hit The Road:
Scan MONSTER.SOU.

Dune 2, Lands Of Lore and Legend Of Kyrandia 2:
Scan all .PAK files.

Mortal Kombat 3:
Scan all .FTR files,

Quake, Quake 2, Hexen 2, Heretic 2, Half-life:
Scan all .PAK files.

WarCraft I/II:
Scan all *.WAR and *.SUD files.

SimCity3000 (perhaps, some other Maxis games):
Add all *.XA files.

Harvester (perhaps, some other FutureVision games):
Add all *.CMP files (music), *.FST files (video) and scan HARVEST.DAT
(sounds) and SOUND.DAT (speech) files.

Broken Sword 2 (perhaps, some other Revolution games):
Add all *.CLUSFX files in CLUSTERS\MUSIC.CLU (music) and all *.CLUSFX
files in CLUSTERS\SPEECH.CLU. You CANNOT find CLUSFX files using
SCAN FILES operation! Use ADD FILES instead.

Atlantis, Aztec, Egypte 2, Atlantis 2 (and other Cryo Interactive games):
Add all *.APC files.

Odyssee (perhaps, some other Cryo Interactive games):
Scan all *.BF files.

The Longest Journey (perhaps, some other FunCom games):
Add all *.ISS files and scan all *.XARC files.

Wing Commander: Prophecy (perhaps, some other Origin games):
Scan all *.TRE files.
