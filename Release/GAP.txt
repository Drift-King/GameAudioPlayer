4 GAP actions
==============

The following subsections describe the GAP actions which may be performed
using the controls in the GAP windows.

4.1 Main (playback) window
===========================

Playback buttons:

PLAY/PAUSE (depending on playback state) -- starts/pauses playback,

STOP -- stops playback,

PREVIOUS -- plays or goes to the previous file in the current playlist,

NEXT -- plays or goes to the next file in the current playlist.

NOTE: Playback trackbar allows you to seek to a position in the played file
      only if the correspondent audio file plug-in supports seek function.
      If it does not support seeking, the trackbar will be disabled (its
      slider will be grayed).

Other buttons:

PLAYLIST -- opens/closes playlist window.

EQUALIZER -- in this version of GAP equalizer is not implemented.

OPTIONS -- brings up options dialog.

INFO -- brings up info dialog.

In the bottom of GAP main window there're current GAP stats:
GAP state: Idle/Playing/Paused <file number>/<number of files>,
Current playback time (elapsed/remaining),
Current audio file type,
Current resource file type.

Right-click on the main window to bring up main pop-up menu:
Always On Top -- makes GAP windows be topmost (that is, always above
all non-topmost ones).
Easy Move -- enables easy movement of GAP main and playback windows which
means that those windows may be moved using any point in the window area
not occupied by any controls.
No Playlist Advance -- just the opposite to "Play next file in playlist"
option in Options dialog.

4.2 Playlist window
====================

Double-clicking on the file in the playlist will start playback of the file.
Clicking on the selected file will start editing name for the file.

Clicking on listview column header sorts the list by the header parameter.

NOTE: You can select multiple files in the playlist using SHIFT and CTRL.

NOTE: Some playlist buttons will be disabled (grayed) if their actions are
      not relevant with the selected files in the playlist.

OK -- closes playlist.

LOAD LIST(S)... -- loads APL playlist.

NOTE: You can select multiple playlist files in the playlist loading dialog:
      press SHIFT and CTRL to use that feature.

SAVE LIST... -- saves APL playlist.

WARNING: Do not try to load files which does not have APL playlist structure.
	 To produce APL playlist files, use ADD FILES/SCAN FILES and then
	 SAVE LIST. If you want to produce APLs manually, refer to the APL
	 format description in the Appendix.

ADD FILE(S)... -- adds files to playlist: select any game files and GAP will
check whether they are in any of the supported format. As games often use
various file extensions for audio files, there's no common rule for files to
try adding. Just try all and see if it works. If not, mail me! If yes, mail
me anyway!

NOTE: Some audio files could not be verified. For such files the correspondent
      plug-in may ask user to specify their parameters. Such behaviour of the
      plug-in is configurable (see Options->AF Plug-Ins->Configuration).
      If asked, you may select different settings and check the result.
      For some audio files it's the only way to determine their parameters.

NOTE: Some resource file plug-ins may also ask user to enter information
      necessary for dealing with resource archives. These plug-ins are also
      configurable (see Options->RF Plug-Ins->Configuration).

ADD DIRECTORY... -- lets you add files from the directory of your choice.

NOTE: Directory browsing dialog lets you enable or disable recursing of chosen
      directory subdirectories.

SCAN FILE(S)... -- selects files to search for supported audio files within.
Same as for ADD FILE(S) button: try to search in all game files.

NOTE: When you select files for ADD or SCAN, GAP checks them all whether they
      are resource library of any supported format. If a file is a resource
      library, added/searched are the files found in it via the correspondent
      resource file plug-in.

NOTE: You can select multiple files in the adding and searching dialogs:
      press SHIFT and CTRL to use that feature (or select multiple files
      by dragging mouse cursor over them).

SCAN DIRECTORY... -- lets you scan files from the directory of your choice.

NOTE: Directory browsing dialog lets you enable or disable recursing of chosen
      directory subdirectories.

PLAY -- plays currently selected audio file.

SAVE FILE(S)... -- saves currently selected audio file(s) "as is". If multiple
files are selected, the saving depends on the saving settings (Saving tab in
Options dialog).

CONVERT FILE(S)... -- converts currently selected audio file(s) to WAV(s). If
multiple files are selected, the saving depends on the saving settings
(Saving tab in Options dialog).

NOTE: Both filename template (for MultiConverting) and ConvertFileName dialogs
let you select WAV format (compression) for converting to WAV. Some formats
may turn out to be not suitable for converting to. GAP will bring up error
message if such format is chosen.

CLEAR LIST -- clears the playlist.

MOVE UP/DOWN -- moves up/down audio file in playlist.

REMOVE -- removes currently selected file(s) from playlist.

DUPLICATE -- duplicates currently selected file.

SELECT... -- brings up playlist selection pop-up menu.

SORT LIST... -- brings up playlist sorting pop-up menu.

FILE INFO -- displays currently selected audio file info box.

FILE TITLE -- lets you change name for currently selected file: this may differ
from the name of file this audio is stored in. For audio found
by SCAN operation, the initial name is <Unknown>. For those added by ADD
operation, the initial name is the correspondent filename.

Right-click on the playlist window to bring up main popup menu or playlist
node context menu.

4.4 Resource file extraction capabilities
==========================================

If the GAP installation contains RAW plug-in, it's possible to use GAP as
a resource extraction tool. Namely, you can extract any file (or group of
any files) from any resource archive supported by GAP via RF plug-ins. To
be able to do that you should change RAW plug-in options:
(Options -> AF Plug-Ins -> ANX RAW Audio File Plug-in -> Configure)
ADD FILES -> Always,
RAW PARAMETERS -> Use defaults.
Press OK to confirm the changes and then you should use ADD FILES for resource
file(s) you want to extract anything from. Depending on the type of resource
file(s) and the options of correspondent RF plug-in(s), you'll either be able
to select file|(s) in the file selection dialog box or just get all files from
the resource file(s) added to the playlist. Now you can select file(s) to
extract in the playlist (or just select all files using SELECT ALL button) and
press SAVE FILE(S) button. Using such technique you may extract file(s) from
the supported resource file(s) even if the files you want to extract are not
audio files supported by GAP (via AF plug-ins). It's possible due to the
ability of RAW plug-in to confirm adding of any file (as the reasonable
verification of RAW files is not possible).

Also, it's possible to create AF plug-in(s) which would support scanning/adding
for non-audio files (graphics, video, script and any other types of data files
stored in resource files), but would not support the playback for those files
(that is, the playback support functions are "fake" ones). Such AF plug-ins
would allow GAP to find/add almost any type of files stored in resource files,
thus, enabling you to find/rip/extract those files from resource files.

5 Options
==========

The following subsections describe the GAP settings which may be set in
the property pages of the options dialog.

5.1 Playback
=============

WAVEOUT DEVICE -- lets you select waveform playback device.

PROCESS PRIORITY CLASS -- sets GAP process priority class.

PLAYBACK BUFFER -- sets playback buffers size.

GAP PRIORITY -- sets GAP main thread priority.

PLAYBACK PRIORITY -- sets GAP playback thread priority.

NOTE: Priority class and thread priorities may be set to higher values,
      if you have audio playback latencies. But the defaults
      ("Normal" for all) is recommended. Too high values may
      negatively affect other applicattions, while too low values
      may negatively affect GAP.

DEFAULTS -- sets default values for all options (RECOMMENDED!).

5.2 Playlist
=============

PLAYLIST TYPE -- sets the type of playlist:
FIXED-SIZE DIALOG (OLD) -- playlist is fixed-size dialog (older variant),
RESIZEABLE WINDOW (NEW) -- playlist is resizeable window (newer variant).

PLAY NEXT FILE IN PLAYLIST -- if checked, the next file in the playlist is
played after current playback finishes. Otherwise playback stops after that.

INTROSCAN -- sets introscan mode and introscan length in seconds.

SHUFFLE -- sets shuffle mode.

REPEAT/ONE/ALL -- sets repeat mode: repeat one file, repeat whole playlist.

LOAD LAST PLAYLIST ON STARTUP -- allows autoloading last playlist during GAP
startup.

PLAY LOADED PLAYLIST ON STARTUP -- allows autoplayback of autoloaded last
playlist just after GAP startup.

ESTIMATE TIME ONLY BEFORE PLAYBACK -- instructs GAP to estimate audio
file length only before playback. Otherwise it tries to do that during
playlist loading, adding audio files to playlist and before playback.
Setting this option is recommended because estimating length for some
audio files when loading playlist may take some time and may be very
annoying.

WHEN LOADING PLAYLIST REPLACE [CD] WITH... -- allows replacing of [CD] string
in the resource filename with CD drive letter of your choice and sets that CD
drive letter.

WHEN SAVING PLAYLIST PUT [CD] FOR CD DRIVE LETTER -- allows replacing of CD
drive letter in the resource filename for files situated on CD with [CD]
string so that saved APL will be usable on systems with other CD drive letter
than that of the system it was saved on.

DRAG & DROP SUPPORT -- sets the support for Drag'n'Drop:
NONE -- no support,
ASK USER ON DROP -- ask user what to do with dropped files,
ADD DROPPED FILES TO PLAYLIST -- when files are dropped over the main or
playlist window, they're added to playlist,
SCAN DROPPED FILES -- when files are dropped over the main or playlist
window, they're scanned for audio files which are then added to playlist,
LOAD DROPPED FILES AS PLAYLISTS -- when files are dropped over the main
or playlist window, they're loaded as APL playlists.

DEFAULTS -- sets default values for all options (RECOMMENDED!).

5.3 Saving
===========

MultiSaving filename -- defines how GAP gets filenames when saving/converting
multiple files:
ASK USER FOR FILENAME FOR EVERY FILE -- when saving/converting multiple files
GAP will ask user for filename for every file being saved.
ASK USER FOR FILENAME TEMPLATE -- when saving/converting multiple files GAP
will ask user for filename template which will then be used for all files
being saved.
USE DEFAULT FILENAME TEMPLATE -- when saving/converting multiple files GAP
will use the default template for all files being saved.

Default template directory -- defines directory for the default filename
template:
CURRENT -- the default template directory is current directory.
CUSTOM -- the default template directory is that in the edit line below.
BROWSE -- lets user browse the default template directory.

Default template file title -- defines file title for the default template:
USE AUDIO FILE TITLE -- audio file title is used for the default template
file title.
USE RESOURCE FILE TITLE -- resource file title is used for the default
template file title.
CUSTOM -- the default template file title is that in the edit control below.

Extension -- defines extension for the default filename tamplate:
DEFAULT -- the default extension for saved file is used for the default
template filename extension.
CUSTOM -- the default filename template extension is that in the edit control
below. You can set it to single point "." to save to files with no extension.

MILTICONVERTING WAV FORMAT -- lets you select default WAV format (compression)
for MultiConverting. Listed in this control will be only WAV formats
supported in your system.

DEFAULTS -- sets default settings.

5.4 Audio file plug-ins (AF plug-ins)
======================================

AUDIO FILE PLUG-IN DIRECTORY -- defines the directory in which GAP will
search for audio file plug-ins. When GAP is started for the first time,
it sets this to "<GAP directory>\Plugins". If you move GAP to other directory
or move plug-ins to the directory other than "Plugins", change this setting!

CONFIGURE -- calls configuration routine of the chosen plug-in.

NOTE: you can also double-click on plug-in description string in the plug-in
      list to call its configuration routine.

ABOUT -- calls about routine of the chosen plug-in.

ALLOW MULTIPLE PLUG-INS TO WORK WITH ONE FILE -- allows multiple audio
plug-ins to try to add files (chosen to add), which may result in many
annoying RAW Parameters dialogs from RAW Plug-In, but it may be used if you
want some files to be added as being in different formats.

5.5 Resource file plug-ins (RF plug-ins)
=========================================

RESOURCE FILE PLUG-IN DIRECTORY -- defines the directory in which GAP will
search for resource file plug-ins. When GAP is started for the first time,
it sets this to "<GAP directory>\Plugins". If you move GAP to other directory
or move plug-ins to the directory other than "Plugins", change this setting!

CONFIGURE -- calls configuration routine of the chosen plug-in.

NOTE: you can also double-click on plug-in description string in the plug-in
      list to call its configuration routine.

ABOUT -- calls about routine of the chosen plug-in.

ALLOW MULTIPLE PLUG-INS TO WORK WITH ONE FILE -- allows multiple resource
plug-ins to try to process files (chosen for adding/searching), which may
result in several addition checks or searches done by different resource file
plug-ins for one file, but it may be used if you want some resource files to
be searched as being in PLAIN format (i.e. make plain file search).

6 Audio file plug-ins configurations
=====================================

The following subsections describe audio file plug-ins configuration
options (for audio file plug-ins requiring configuration).

6.1 ACM plug-in configuration
==============================

DISABLE ACM SEARCH -- disables search (SCAN FILES) opportunity for ACMs.

ENABLE CHANNELS CHECK -- enables channels number check when verifying
added/found file. This's recommended.

ENABLE PACK ATTRIBUTES CHECK -- enables pack attributes check when verifying
added/found file. This's NOT recommended.

The above two options may be used in order to avoid finding fake (incorrect)
files.

ACM FILE SIZE -- controls the means plug-in uses to determine found ACM size:
ESTIMATE -- estimate ACM size using "size" ACM header field (fast, but VERY
inaccurate).
WALK THE WHOLE ACM -- walk the whole found ACM file to determine its size.
This's recommended setting.

ACM CHANNELS -- controls the behaviour of plug-in when determining the number
of channels for ACM file (which may be 1 or 2 (mono and stereo)):
USE HEADER VALUE -- plug-in will use channels number value, stored in ACM header.
TRY TO GUESS -- plug-in will try to determine channels number itself.
ASK USER     -- plug-in will ask user to set channels number.
USE DEFAULT  -- plug-in will use the default value for channels number.

NOTE: All music files in Fallout 1,2 are stereo while all sounds/speech are mono.

CHANNELS DEFAULT -- sets the default value for channels number:
MONO	-- the default is mono (1 channel).
STEREO	-- the default is stereo (2 channels).

DEFAULTS -- sets the default settings for all options.

6.2 ASF plug-in configuration
==============================

IGNORE ASF LOOP BLOCKS -- makes plug-in ignore ASF loop blocks, so that
looped songs are played once (without looping). Otherwise such songs are
played repeatedly.

WALK ASF BLOCKS CHAIN BEFORE PLAYBACK -- makes plug-in walk ASF blocks
chain when preparing for playback, so that seeking and looping will be
done fast. May take much time when starting playback.

CHECK SAMPLE RATE -- check sample rate header field of the file when verifying
added/found file.

CHECK CHANNELS NUMBER -- check channels number header field of the file when
verifying added/found file.

CHECK RESOLUTION -- check resolution header field of the file when verifying
added/found file.

The above three options are recommended in order to avoid finding fake
(incorrect) files.

USE SAMPLE CLIPPING FOR DECOMPRESSION -- makes plug-in use sample clipping
for IMA ADPCM data decompression. You may turn this setting on and off to
avoid "popping" in sound playback.

DEFAULTS -- sets the default settings for all options.

6.3 AUD plug-in configuration
==============================

USE "OUTSIZE" AUD HEADER FIELD -- instructs plug-in to use "outsize" field of
AUD header for calculation of AUD time. Fast, but may be inaccurate and is
only applyable for new AUDs (ignored for others).

USE "SIZE" AUD HEADER FIELD AND ESTIMATE -- instructs plug-in to use "size"
field of AUD header for calculation of AUD time. Fast, but only applyable for
IMA ADPCM compressed AUDs (ignored for others).

USE AUD FILE SIZE AND ESTIMATE -- instructs plug-in to use file size of AUD
file for calculation of AUD time. Fast, but only applyable for IMA ADPCM
compressed AUDs (ignored for others).

WALK AUD CHUNKS CHAIN -- instructs plug-in to walk AUD chunks chain for
calculation of AUD time. May be TOO SLOW.

USE "OUTSIZE" AUD CHUNK HEADER FIELD -- makes plug-in use "outsize" AUD
chunk header field when walking AUD chunks chain for calculation of AUD
time. May be inaccurate. Applyable for all AUDs.

USE "SIZE" AUD CHUNK HEADER FIELD -- makes plug-in use "size" AUD chunk
header field when walking AUD chunks chain for calculation of AUD time.
May be inaccurate. Only applyable for IMA ADPCM compressed AUDs (ignored
for others).

DON'T USE WALKING IF FAILED TO ESTIMATE BY FAST METHODS -- disables
walking for the cases when fast methods (all other than walking) failed
to get data for calculation of AUD time. This IS RECOMMENDED, because
walking may be TOO SLOW, but if used this setting will disable playback
trackbar for Westwood-compressed AUDs as well as it will disable you to seek
in those AUDs.

IMA ADPCM DECOMPRESSION options:

USE SAMPLE CLIPPING FOR DECOMPRESSION -- makes plug-in use 16-bit sample
clipping for IMA ADPCM data decompression. You may turn this setting on and
off to avoid "popping" in sound playback.

USE SAMPLE ENHANCEMENT FOR DECOMPRESSION -- makes plug-in use 16-bit sample
enhancement for IMA ADPCM data decompression. This may improve sound quality
for some loud files which sound noisy.

DEFAULTS -- sets the default settings for all options.

6.4 RAW plug-in configuration
==============================

ADD FILES -- sets RAW Plug-In behaviour when adding files:
ALWAYS			     -- Add any file as RAW.
ONLY WITH RAW/SND EXTENSIONS -- Add only files with RAW/SND extensions.
NEVER			     -- Never add files as RAW.

RAW PARAMETERS -- set RAW Plug-In behaviour for getting RAW parameters:
ASK USER	-- Ask user to specify RAW file parameters.
ASSUME DEFAULTS -- Assume default values for RAW file parameters.

DEFAULT PARAMETERS -- Default values for RAW file parameters:
SAMPLE RATE	      -- Sample rate.
CHANNELS	      -- Channels: mono/stereo/etc.
RESOLUTION	      -- Resolution: 8-bit/16-bit.
BYTE ORDER	      -- Byte order: little-endian/big-endian (Intel/Motorola).
FORMAT		      -- RAW data format: signed/unsigned/sign-bit/u-law/A-law.

DEFAULTS -- sets default values for all options.

6.5 SOL plug-in configuration
==============================

ENABLE EXTRA CHECKS -- enables some extra checks when searching for SOLs and
verifying stand-alone SOLs. This should prevent plug-in from finding fake SOLs,
but this also may prevent it from finding non-standard SOLs.

DECODING SCHEME DETECTION -- defines how the plug-in detects decoding scheme
for SOL ADPCM-compressed SOLs:
USE HEADER -- use header to detect decoding scheme: if header size is equal
to the shift byte in header, "old" scheme is used, otherwise "new" scheme is used,
DECODE FIRST 1 KB OF DATA -- decode first 1 KB of compressed data to determine
which scheme is more suitable for that SOL. This is RECOMMENDED, while this
may sometimes fail.

USE SAMPLE CLIPPING FOR DECOMPRESSION -- makes plug-in use sample clipping
for SOL ADPCM data decompression. You may turn this setting on and off to
avoid "popping" in sound playback.

USE SOL LOW-PASS FILTER FOR 8-BIT SOUND -- makes plug-in use SOL low-pass
filter for SOL ADPCM compressed 8-bit sound. This's aimed at removing minor
noise in such sound.

USE SOL LOW-PASS FILTER FOR 16-BIT SOUND -- makes plug-in use SOL low-pass
filter for SOL ADPCM compressed 16-bit sound.

DEFAULTS -- sets default values for all options.

6.6 EACS plug-in configuration
==================================

DISABLE LOOPING -- plug-in will ignore .ASF loop blocks and .MUS loops in
.LIN/.MAP. Otherwise files containing loop blocks or .LIN/.MAP loops will
be played repeatedly.

WALK BLOCKS/SECTIONS CHAIN BEFORE PLAYBACK -- plug-in will walk the whole
block chain of the file before its playback, so that seek and looping will be
performed almost without latency, but walking itself may take quite much time.

DISABLE TIME CALCULATION FOR MUS FILES -- disables time calculation for
.LIN/.MAP-driven multi-header (MUS) files. This procedure may took quite
long and it also makes many seeks (which is bad for CD drives).

.LIN/.MAP FILE FOR MULTI-HEADER (MUS) FILE -- sets plug-in behaviour when it
needs .LIN/.MAP file for MUS playback:

DEFAULT: <MUSFILENAME>.LIN/.MAP -- use <MUSFileName>.LIN/.MAP located in
the same directory as MUS file. Plug-in first tries to open .LIN file and
then (if it fails) it tries to open .MAP file.
ASK USER -- ask user for .LIN/.MAP file name.

USE SAMPLE CLIPPING FOR DECOMPRESSION -- makes plug-in use sample clipping
for EA ADPCM data decompression. You may turn this setting on and off to
avoid "popping" in sound playback.

DEFAULTS -- sets default values for all options.

6.7 WADSFX plug-in configuration
=================================

DISABLE WADSFX SEARCH -- disables search (SCAN FILES) opportunity for
WADSFX files. This IS RECOMMENDED, as enabling WADSFX search will decrease
the scanning speed a lot! Instead of searching for WADSFXes, use ADD FILES
for WAD files!

CHECK SAMPLE RATE -- enables sample rate check when searching for WADSFX files.
This has no effect if WADSFX search is disabled and this's recommended otherwise.

DEFAULTS -- sets the default settings for all options.

6.8 MVE plug-in configuration
=================================

DON'T USE WALKING FOR TIME CALCULATION -- disables walking for the calculation
of MVE soundtrack time. This is RECOMMENDED, because walking may be TOO SLOW,
but if used this setting will disable playback position tracking (as well as
time counter) when playing back MVE soundtrack.

DEFAULTS -- sets the default settings for all options.

6.9 BNK plug-in configuration
==============================

USE SAMPLE CLIPPING FOR DECOMPRESSION -- makes plug-in use sample clipping
for EA ADPCM data decompression. You may turn this setting on and off to
avoid "popping" in sound playback.

6.10 APC plug-in configuration
===============================

APC SEARCH AND VERIFICATION options:

CHECK VERSION (1.20) -- check APC file version (equal to 1.20). It
is not recommended to set this, as different versions may use the same
format. However, different versions may prove to be incompatible causing
the plug-in to malfunction, in which case it's wise to perform the
version check.

CHECK SAMPLE RATE -- check APC file sample rate. It's recommended to
turn this on, as it's most likely a harmless ckeck.

CHECK CHANNELS NUMBER -- check the number of channels of APC file. It's
recommended to turn this on in a case when the plug-in finds false or
unhandlable APCs during scanning.

CHECK IF THE FILE IS AN EMBEDDED SOUNDTRACK -- if the found APC file signature
corresponds to HNM video soundtrack, the plug-in will skip that signature.

IMA ADPCM DECOMPRESSION options:

USE SAMPLE CLIPPING FOR DECOMPRESSION -- makes plug-in use 16-bit sample
clipping for IMA ADPCM data decompression. You may turn this setting on and
off to avoid "popping" in sound playback.

USE SAMPLE ENHANCEMENT FOR DECOMPRESSION -- makes plug-in use 16-bit sample
enhancement for IMA ADPCM data decompression. This may improve sound quality
for some loud files which sound noisy.

DEFAULTS -- sets the default settings for all options.

6.11 ISS plug-in configuration
===============================

ISS SEARCH AND VERIFICATION options:

not recommended to use. Turn this on only in case of finding too many
false ISSes when scanning files.

CHECK CHANNELS NUMBER -- check the number of channels of ISS file. It's
recommended to turn this on in a case when the plug-in finds false or
unhandlable ISSes during scanning.

CHECK FIELD "UNKNOWN1" -- check ISS header field "unknown1". Use this
ONLY in case of finding too many false ISSes when scanning files.

CHECK SAMPLE RATE -- check ISS file sample rate. Use this ONLY in case
of finding too many false ISSes when scanning files.

CHECK FIELD "UNKNOWN2" -- check ISS header field "unknown2". Use this
ONLY in case of finding too many false ISSes when scanning files.

CHECK VERSION (1.000) -- check ISS file version (equal to 1.000). It
is not recommended to set this, as different versions may use the same
format. However, different versions may prove to be incompatible causing
the plug-in to malfunction, in which case it's wise to perform the
version check.

SET AUDIO FILE NAME TO THE ID STORED IN FILE -- makes the plug-in set
the audio file name (when adding a found/verified file to the playlist)
to the internal name stored in ISS file.

IMA ADPCM DECOMPRESSION options:

USE SAMPLE CLIPPING FOR DECOMPRESSION -- makes plug-in use 16-bit sample
clipping for IMA ADPCM data decompression. You may turn this setting on and
off to avoid "popping" in sound playback.

USE SAMPLE ENHANCEMENT FOR DECOMPRESSION -- makes plug-in use 16-bit sample
enhancement for IMA ADPCM data decompression. This may improve sound quality
for some loud files which sound noisy.

DEFAULTS -- sets the default settings for all options.

6.12 XA plug-in configuration
==============================

XA SEARCH/VERIFICATION options:

CHECK TAG -- check XA header tag (equal to 0x0001). This's
not recommended to use. Turn this on only in case of finding too many
false XAs when scanning files.

CHECK CHANNELS NUMBER -- check the number of channels of XA file. It's
recommended to turn this on in a case when the plug-in finds false or
unhandlable XAs during scanning.

CHECK SAMPLE RATE -- check XA header sample rate. It's recommended to
turn this on in a case when the plug-in finds false or unhandlable XAs
during scanning.

CHECK AVERAGE BYTE RATE -- check XA header average byte rate. It's
recommended to turn this on as it should not cause any harm.

CHECK ALIGN -- check XA header align value. It's recommended to turn
this on as it should not cause any harm.

CHECK RESOLUTION -- check XA header sample resolution. It's recommended
to turn this on in a case when the plug-in finds false or unhandlable
XAs during scanning.

EA ADPCM DECOMPRESSION options:

USE SAMPLE CLIPPING FOR DECOMPRESSION -- makes plug-in use 16-bit sample
clipping for EA ADPCM data decompression. You may turn this setting on and
off to avoid "popping" in sound playback.

DEFAULTS -- sets the default settings for all options.

6.13 CMP plug-in configuration
===============================

CMP SEARCH AND VERIFICATION options:

CHECK RESOLUTION -- check CMP header sample resolution. It's recommended
to turn this on in a case when the plug-in finds false or unhandlable
CMPs during scanning.

CHECK SAMPLE RATE -- check CMP file sample rate. It's recommended to
turn this on, as it's most likely a harmless ckeck.

COMPRESSED STREAM START/STOP POSITIONS -- defines the start/stop positions of
the compressed stream in CMP file (relative to the file beginning):
Start at 0xE  -- stream starts at 0xE (right after CMP header),
Start at 0x12 -- stream starts at 0x12 (after odd after-header values),
Start at 0x45 -- stream starts at 0x45 (after all after-header data).
The last choice seems to be the most reasonable.

SKIP STREAM TAIL -- skip the ending 17 bytes of compressed stream. For some
CMP files this tail consists of garbage data, resulting in considerable "popping"
at the end of CMP file playback. Most of CMP files have the correct tails.

IMA ADPCM DECOMPRESSION options:

USE SAMPLE CLIPPING FOR DECOMPRESSION -- makes plug-in use 16-bit sample
clipping for IMA ADPCM data decompression. You may turn this setting on and
off to avoid "popping" in sound playback.

USE SAMPLE ENHANCEMENT FOR DECOMPRESSION -- makes plug-in use 16-bit sample
enhancement for IMA ADPCM data decompression. This may improve sound quality
for some loud files which sound noisy.

DEFAULTS -- sets the default settings for all options.

6.14 FST plug-in configuration
===============================

FST SEARCH AND VERIFICATION options:

CHECK IMAGE WIDTH -- check FST video file image width. It's recommended
to turn this on, as it's most likely a harmless ckeck.

CHECK IMAGE HEIGHT -- check FST video file image height. It's recommended
to turn this on, as it's most likely a harmless ckeck.

CHECK FIELD "UNKNOWN1" -- check FST header field "unknown1". It's recommended
to turn this on ONLY in a case when the plug-in finds false or unhandlable
FSTs during scanning.

CHECK FRAME RATE -- check FST video file frame rate. It's recommended to turn
this on ONLY in a case when the plug-in finds false or unhandlable FSTs
during scanning.

CHECK SAMPLE RATE -- check FST file sample rate. It's recommended
to turn this on, as it's most likely a harmless ckeck.

CHECK RESOLUTION -- check FST header sample resolution. It's recommended
to turn this on, as it's most likely a harmless ckeck.

CHECK FIELD "UNKNOWN2" -- check FST header field "unknown2". It's recommended
to turn this on ONLY in a case when the plug-in finds false or unhandlable
FSTs during scanning.

DEFAULTS -- sets the default settings for all options.

6.15 MGI plug-in configuration
===============================

MGI SEARCH/VERIFICATION options:

CHECK HEADER FIELD "UNKNOWN1" -- check MGI header field "unknown1" (equal 
to 0). This's not recommended to use. Turn this on only in case of finding 
too many false MGIs when scanning/adding files.

CHECK HEADER FIELD "UNKNOWN2" -- check MGI header field "unknown2" (equal 
to 0). This's not recommended to use. Turn this on only in case of finding 
too many false MGIs when scanning/adding files.

CHECK NUMBER OF SECTIONS -- check whether the number of MGI sections stored 
in the beginning of section descriptors table is greater than any section 
pointer in the interactive playback descriptors table. It's recommended to 
turn this on in a case when the plug-in finds false or unhandlable MGIs 
during scanning/adding files.

CHECK DATA START POSITION -- check whether data start position for the 
first section descriptor corresponds to the end of MGI section descriptors 
table. It's recommended to turn this on in a case when the plug-in finds 
false or unhandlable MGIs during scanning/adding files.

CHECK SECTIONS INDICES -- check whether any section index in the MGI section 
descriptors table is less than the number of section indices stored in the 
MGI header. It's recommended to turn this on in a case when the plug-in 
finds false or unhandlable MGIs during scanning/adding files.

CHECK THE LAST SECTION DESCRIPTOR -- check the last section descriptor: 
it should describe the empty section with zero index. It's recommended to 
turn this on in a case when the plug-in finds false or unhandlable MGIs 
during scanning/adding files.

STORE SECTIONS TABLE POSITION (IN AFDATA) -- instructs the plug-in to 
store the starting position of MGI section descriptors table in the 
AFDataString corresponding to the given audio file. This helps to speed up 
the initialization of the audio file playback.

PERFORM THOROUGH SEARCH/VERIFICATION -- instructs the plug-in to perform 
thorough checks of MGI file when scanning/adding, namely, with this 
option on, the verification will include MGI section descriptors table 
checks. It's recommended to turn this on in a case when the plug-in finds 
false or unhandlable MGIs during scanning/adding files.

EA ADPCM DECOMPRESSION options:

USE SAMPLE CLIPPING FOR DECOMPRESSION -- makes plug-in use 16-bit sample
clipping for EA ADPCM data decompression. You may turn this setting on and
off to avoid "popping" in sound playback.

DEFAULTS -- sets the default settings for all options.

7 Resource file plug-ins configurations
========================================

The following subsections describe resource file plug-ins configuration
options (for resource file plug-ins requiring configuration).

7.1 MPQ plug-in configuration
==============================

PATH TO STORM.DLL -- sets the path (with filename) to Blizzard STORM library.
This setting takes effect only on the start of Storm operation, e.g. on
the start of WAV playback, etc.

SPEEDING UP MPQ VERIFICATION -- allows to speed up MPQ verification for
add/search actions:
CHECK EXTENSION  -- enables file extension check.
CHECK MPQ HEADER -- enables file header check.

NOTE: MPQ verification (without speed-ups like the above) may be VERY LONG
      for large files which ARE NOT MPQs! So speeding up MPQ verification is
      RECOMMENDED. But be careful: MPQ header check is not recommended because
      for many MPQ-containing files (like some EXEs) this check fails!
      Moreover, extension check may fail for non-standard MPQ-containing files
      (I have not seen such files yet, but they may exist), so for such
      "suspecious" files I can recommend TURNING OFF ANY speeding up for
      MPQ verification, but ONLY for such files!

ASK USER TO SELECT FILES FROM LIST -- ask user to select files from opened
MPQ archive for adding/searching. Otherwise, all files from the archive will
be processed.

FILE LIST FOR MPQ ARCHIVE -- sets the MPQ Plug-In behaviour for getting file
list for MPQ archive:
USE DEFAULT: <MPQFILENAME>.TXT	    -- use default file list filename.
ASK USER FOR MPQ FILE LIST FILENAME -- ask user to set file list filename.

NOTE: MPQ filelists shipped with GAP does not bear default names, so usage
      of default file list filename is NOT RECOMMENDED.

FILE LISTS DIRECTORY -- sets the default directory for filelists (used to
access files in MPQ archives). This directory will be the first directory
in filelist selection dialog (when user is asked for filelist filename) and
it will be used for default filelist filename composition (if the default
filelist is used). It's recommended to keep all MPQ filelists in one directory
and configure the plug-in to use that directory.

DEFAULTS -- sets the default settings for all options.

7.2 WAD plug-in configuration
==============================

ASK USER TO SELECT LUMPS FROM LIST -- ask user to select lumps from opened
WAD archive for adding/searching. Otherwise, all files from the archive will
be processed.

ADD LUMP INDEX TO LUMPNAME -- prepends lump index to resource file data string.
This helps the plug-in to open that lump faster.

DEFAULTS -- sets the default settings for all options.

7.3 DSND plug-in configuration
===============================

ASK USER TO SELECT FILES FROM LIST -- ask user to select files from opened
DSND/PIG archive for adding/searching. Otherwise, all files from the archive
will be processed.

ADD FILE INDEX TO FILENAME -- prepends file index to resource file data string.
This helps the plug-in to open that file faster.

DEFAULTS -- sets the default settings for all options.

7.4 GRP plug-in configuration
==============================

ASK USER TO SELECT FILES FROM LIST -- ask user to select files from opened
GRP archive for adding/searching. Otherwise, all files from the archive will
be processed.

ADD FILE INDEX TO FILENAME -- prepends file index to resource file data string.
This helps the plug-in to open that file faster.

DEFAULTS -- sets the default settings for all options.

7.5 BLB plug-in configuration
==============================

ASK USER TO SELECT FILES FROM LIST -- ask user to select files from opened
BLB archive for adding/searching. Otherwise, all files from the archive will
be processed.

ADD FILE INDEX TO FILENAME -- prepends file index to resource file data string.
This helps the plug-in to open that file faster.

SUPPORT PKWARE-COMPRESSED FILES -- enables the support for PKWARE-compressed
files in BLB resources. This support requires PKWARE.DLL. If you turn it off
PKWARE.DLL will not be loaded or used, so you may delete this DLL.

NOTE: Music files in BLB resources are not PKWARE-compressed, while the most
      of sounds are compressed.

CHECK DECOMPRESSION RESULT -- when PKWARE-compressed files support is active,
this setting lets the plug-in check whether PKWARE-compressed files
decompression was successful. This may prevent the plug-in from opening some
oddly-compressed files. Turn it off to be able to handle such files.

DEFAULTS -- sets the default settings for all options.

7.6 CLU plug-in configuration
==============================

ASK USER TO SELECT FILES FROM LIST -- ask user to select files from opened
CLU archive for adding/searching. Otherwise, all files from the archive will
be processed.

DEFAULTS -- sets the default settings for all options.

9 Known problems
=================

ACM plug-in:
ACM file structure is uncertain and thus ACM search is poorly implemented.
The plug-in cannot reliably determine channels number of ACM file (which is
either guessed or set by user).

MVE plug-in:
The plug-in does not support good (fast) seeking and time calculation.

SOL plug-in:
The decoding scheme (using or not using compressed code complement) detection
is poorly implemented: the plug-in decodes first 1 KB of compressed data and
determines which scheme is more suitable. It also seems that SOL ADPCM
compressed 8-bit files in some games have minor noise, which is not completely
removed by SOL LPF scheme.

BNK plug-in:
The plug-in plays ONLY EA ADPCM (7) BNK sections.
I know nothing about others to support them anyhow...

MGI plug-in: 
The plug-in cannot perform seeking precisely enough due to the dependency 
of seeking precision on section sizes in MGI file: when the section is 
large, seeking precision is very rough.

10 Future plans
================

-- Implementation of equalizer/noise filter
-- Making use (if possible) of WinAmp vis/dsp plug-ins

11 Project

13 Appendix: ANX APL playlist format
=====================================

APL consists of the strings, each is ended by a newline, one string for
one audio file. Each string has the following format:

<Name> <AFType> <AFInfo> <ResFileName> <RFType> <RFInfo> Start Length

NOTE: "<" and ">" characters are important delimiters!

where:

Name -- Audio file name.

AFType -- Audio file type. Refer to audio file plug-ins source code for their
type strings.

AFInfo -- Audio file info. Refer to the audio file plug-in source code to
find out whether it requires AFInfo and details on the format of AFInfo.

ResFileName -- filename for the resource file audio file is contained in,
(use "[CD]" for CD drive letter to enable APLs to be usable on systems with
other CD drive letter that your system has -- refer to Options section for
more details on this feature)

RFType -- resource file/library type. Refer to resource file plug-ins source
code for their type strings.

RFInfo -- resource file info. Refer to the resource file plug-in source code
to find out whether it requires RFInfo and details on the format of RFInfo.

Start -- start position of audio file in the file determined by
ResFileName and RFInfo (HEXADECIMAL).

Length -- length of audio file in the file determined by
ResFileName and RFInfo (HEXADECIMAL). May be FFFFFFFF for audio file
spreading up to the end of file it's contained in.

NOTE: The above two numbers are required for ALL audio files even if
      they are single standalone files not contained in any archive! And
      these two numbers are important, because placing game files into
      resource library or even into a file contained in the resource
      library itself is a common thing for many-many-many games.

NOTE: If a parameter is not required (like AFInfo for most plug-ins),
      there should be corresponding "<>" delimiters pair for that parameter
      anyway!

NOTE: Strings enclosed in "<>" delimiters should have equal number of "<" and
      ">" symbols, otherwise GAP will fail to get right string.
