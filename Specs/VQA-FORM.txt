VQA Format (for Tiberian Sun) by Olaf van der Spek <Olaf@XCC.TMFWeb.NL>

If a chunk id contains a 'z' as last character, it's a format80 encoded chunk.

FINF chunk

Each movie has one FINF chunk. It contains frame information. It has count frames entries of 4 bytes. Each entry, when multiplied by two, points to the SND chunk of the corresponding frame.

VQFR chunk

Each frame has one VQFR chunk. It can contain CBF and VPRZ or VPTR sub-chunks.

CBF chunk

Each movie has one CBF chunk in the first VQFR chunk. The first byte is unused, the second byte is the start of a format80 encoded block. When decoded, this block is (almost) always a multiple of 32 bytes. I think this is because it contains entries of 4 (header.cx_block) x 4 (header.cy_block) 16 bit pixels.

VPRZ chunk

This chunk is always encoded.

VPTR chunk

This chunk is never encoded.
